## About me
I am a student of Data Science and Economics at Northeastern University, with a strong interest in sports analytics, predictive modeling, and data analytics. My work focuses on utilizing data-driven methods to analyze real-world systems, identify patterns, and inform decision-making.

## Featured Projects

# Who Will Go Pro? College Hockey Predictive Modeling

Led a four-person team to collect, clean, and standardize 15,000+ rows of NCAA Division I women’s hockey data (2019–2025) for both skaters and goalies. Engineered performance features and built classification models in Python using scikit-learn to predict which players are most likely to advance to professional leagues.

The final models achieved up to 94% accuracy and 100% precision for goalies and 90% accuracy with 92% precision for skaters. Model outputs were used to evaluate Northeastern Women’s Hockey players’ likelihood of advancing to the PWHL.

Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn) 

# NBA Data Analysis: Growth of the Three-Point Shot 

Processed and analyzed NBA game-level data from 1979–2025 using Python and pandas to examine long-term trends in three-point shooting and its relationship to team success. Built multi-decade visual analyses in Matplotlib, including trend lines, stacked bar charts, and z-score comparisons of championship teams versus league averages.

Findings showed that teams with above-average three-point performance were increasingly more likely to achieve postseason success, particularly in the modern NBA era.

Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

# The Gini Coefficient and the Environment

Developed and evaluated an OLS regression model across 169 countries to analyze how environmental and political variables relate to income inequality. The analysis examined factors including GDP (PPP), renewable energy share, and governance indicators using cross-country data.

Results identified GDP (PPP) and renewable energy share as statistically significant predictors of the Gini coefficient, highlighting relationships between economic development, sustainability, and inequality.

Tools: Stata
