# Sophia Hughes  
**Data Science & Economics @ Northeastern University**

Welcome to my project portfolio. This site highlights selected projects in data science, including predictive modeling and machine learning methods, as well as work in economics and applied analytics.

## Featured Projects
### 🏒 Who Will Go Pro? College Hockey Predictive Modeling
Built classification models in Python using scikit-learn to predict which NCAA Division I women’s hockey players are most likely to advance to professional leagues and applied the results to analyze the Northeastern Women’s Hockey roster.
Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)

### 🏀 NBA Data Analysis: Growth of the Three-Point Shot
Analyzed NBA game-level data (1979–2025) to examine long-term trends in three-point shooting and its relationship to team success. Created multi-decade visualizations and statistical comparisons of championship teams versus league averages.
Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

### 🌍 The Gini Coefficient and the Environment
Developed an OLS regression model across 169 countries to analyze how environmental and political factors relate to income inequality. Identified GDP (PPP) and renewable energy share as statistically significant predictors of the Gini coefficient.
Tools: Stata
