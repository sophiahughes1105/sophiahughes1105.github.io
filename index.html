  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div class="about-container">
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate Data Science and Economics student at Northeastern University, while currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Economics with a concentration in Data Science. 
      I am interested in applying statistical modeling and machine learning to analyze real-world problems and generate actionable insights.
    </p> 
    <p>
      My work spans predictive modeling, data visualization, and statistical analysis using tools such as Python, R, SQL, and scikit-learn. I am particularly interested in 
      sports analytics, performance analytics, and applied economic analysis, and I enjoy using data to identify patterns, evaluate performance, and communicate results clearly.
    </p>
    <p></p>
      I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my analytical and technical skills in data science and analytics roles where data can support informed decision-making and strategy.

  <h3>🏒 Who Will Go Pro? College Hockey Predictive Modeling</h3>
  <p>
  This project applies machine learning methods to develop a predictive analytics model that identifies NCAA Division I women’s hockey players most likely to advance to the
    professional level. Using collegiate player statistics and team performance data, the model analyzes patterns associated with post-collegiate advancement and evaluates 
    classification performance across both skaters and goalies. By examining historical player outcomes and performance metrics, the analysis highlights which variables are 
    most associated with progression to professional leagues and how predictive modeling can be used to evaluate player development pathways.
  </p>
  <p>
  Northeastern University’s program serves as a strong case study due to its consistent national competitiveness and history of producing professional-level players. 
    Through feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, this project demonstrates how data-driven modeling can support scouting insights, performance evaluation,
    and long-term player development analysis. More broadly, the project illustrates how machine learning techniques can be applied within sports analytics to identify trends in 
    athlete progression and translate performance data into actionable insights for teams, analysts, and decision-makers.

  <h3>🏀 NBA Data Analysis: Growth of the Three-Point Shot</h3>
  <p>
    Over the last few decades, the NBA has changed in a significant way: teams are shooting
    more three-pointers than ever before, and this completely reshaped how the game is played.
    What started as a relatively minor part of the game has now become a central strategy, with
    many teams building their offense around it. Teams now rely on the three-point shot, but it is still
    not clear whether this shift has led to better results. Are teams that take more threes consistently
    more successful? Do they win more games or make the playoffs more often? Looking at teams
    from different eras, it can be seen not just how much more players shoot from deep now, but
    how much more important that shot has become. The goal of this analysis is to answer how the rise
    of the three-point shot has impacted scoring, team success, and the overall strategy of the game.

  <h3>🌍 The Gini Coefficient and the Environment</h3>
  <p>
    Income inequality is a global issue that has significant economic, social, and political
    effects. Additionally, harmful environmental actions and practices are seen to destroy natural
    resources, disrupt ecosystems, and disproportionately harm vulnerable and disadvantaged
    populations that do not have the technology or infrastructure to adapt to climate change and
    global warming.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this project is to construct a model that predicts a country’s Gini coefficient
    based on various environmental variables through a cross-sectional analysis of data. An ordinary 
    least squares (OLS) regression in STATA was utilized to explore the relationship between the Gini
    coefficient and the various independent variables. While the Gini coefficient could be used as an
    independent variable to explain a country’s environmental practices, this model treats it as the
    dependent variable, as the focus is on understanding how environmental factors contribute to
    income inequality. Poor environmental practices and income inequality can be thought of as a
    positive feedback loop: while economic disparities may influence environmental policies and
    environmental degradation, the consequences disproportionately affect lower-income
    populations and thus further widen inequality.
