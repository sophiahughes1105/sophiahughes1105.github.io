  <h3>🏒 Who Will Go Pro? College Hockey Predictive Modeling</h3>
  <p>
    Women’s sports have historically received significantly fewer resources, media coverage, and fan
    engagement compared to men’s sports, despite comparable skill levels and competitive quality. This
    disparity extends to collegiate hockey, where women’s hockey teams frequently operate with limited
    visibility despite delivering exceptional athletic performances, while men’s college hockey enjoys robust
    fan bases and substantial recruiting resources.
    The recent establishment of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) in 2023 signals growing
    momentum for women's hockey at the professional level, creating new pathways and heightened interest
    in the sport. By developing a predictive analytics model that forecasts player performance and team
    outcomes, greater fan investment can be generated, demonstrating the value of data-driven player
    development, and ultimately contribute to closing the resource gap for women’s hockey.
    Northeastern University’s Women’s Hockey program is one of the most dominant forces in the National
    Collegiate Athletic Association’s Division I league; the team is consistently ranked as one of the best in
    the country and produces notable skaters and goalies each year. Because of this, the Northeastern
    Women’s Hockey team provides a strong foundation in developing a machine learning model to forecast
    which players on the team are predicted to continue their careers at the professional level.

  <h3>🏀 NBA Data Analysis: Growth of the Three-Point Shot</h3>
  <p>
    Over the last few decades, the NBA has changed in a significant way: teams are shooting
    more three-pointers than ever before, and this completely reshaped how the game is played.
    What started as a relatively minor part of the game has now become a central strategy, with
    many teams building their offense around it. Teams now rely on the three-point shot, but it is still
    not clear whether this shift has led to better results. Are teams that take more threes consistently
    more successful? Do they win more games or make the playoffs more often? Looking at teams
    from different eras, it can be seen not just how much more players shoot from deep now, but
    how much more important that shot has become. The goal of this analysis is to answer how the rise
    of the three-point shot has impacted scoring, team success, and the overall strategy of the game.

  <h3>🌍 The Gini Coefficient and the Environment</h3>
  <p>
    Income inequality is a global issue that has significant economic, social, and political
    effects. Additionally, harmful environmental actions and practices are seen to destroy natural
    resources, disrupt ecosystems, and disproportionately harm vulnerable and disadvantaged
    populations that do not have the technology or infrastructure to adapt to climate change and
    global warming.
    The goal of this project is to construct a model that predicts a country’s Gini coefficient
    based on various environmental variables through a cross-sectional analysis of data. An ordinary 
    least squares (OLS) regression in STATA was utilized to explore the relationship between the Gini
    coefficient and the various independent variables. While the Gini coefficient could be used as an
    independent variable to explain a country’s environmental practices, this model treats it as the
    dependent variable, as the focus is on understanding how environmental factors contribute to
    income inequality. Poor environmental practices and income inequality can be thought of as a
    positive feedback loop: while economic disparities may influence environmental policies and
    environmental degradation, the consequences disproportionately affect lower-income
    populations and thus further widen inequality.
